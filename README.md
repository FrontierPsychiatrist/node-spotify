node-spotify
============
Overview
--------
node-spotify is a node.js module to use the Spotify API in an easy manner from node.js.

The node.js module is a native module written mainly in C++.

A webpage for the project is here: http://www.node-spotify.com.

Notes
-----
I'm working toward version 1.0.0 which is not meant to provide everything libspotify offers. But I intend to wrap all libspotify types and provide methods
to access them where possible. Options and convenience features my lack, though.

Requirements
------------
You need a spotify premium account to build or use node-spotify. This is a requirement for using libspotify, sorry. You also need an appkey that comes with a premium account (https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#application-keys).

Dependencies
------------
node-gyp and libspotify are required for building. Under Linux you need libasound2-dev additionally. Install node-gyp via ```npm install -g node-gyp```.

Your compiler must be able to translate some C++11 features (std::shared_ptr, G++ 4.7 or Clang 3.2 should do).

Compiling
---------
Compiling was tested on Raspbian, Ubuntu and OSX. Due to the usage of pthreads I'm not sure if node-spotify will compile on Windows.

If you use OSX and have installed libspotify as a framework you need to edit the binding.gyp file. Remove "-lspotify" and write instead as one link option:
```"-framework OpenAL -framework libspotify"```. This is due to a bug in node-gyp that will eliminate a duplicate "-framework" entry from the link settings. If you
have installed libspotify via homebrew you don't need this step.

Change into the main folder (where binding.gyp lies) and run ```node-gyp configure && node-gyp build```.

Now the spotify module lies in ./build/Release/spotify.js. You can use it in a node.js program like so

```javascript
var spotify = require('./build/Release/spotify')( {
  appkeyFile: './spotify_appkey.key'
});
```

The appkey file can be obtained from https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#application-keys (choose binary, not C-code).

Binary distribution
-------------------
As of version 0.4.0 downloads of the pure compiled node.js module are available at http://www.node-spotify.com. I'll try to provide OSX, Linux x86_64 (ALSA) and Linux ARMv6hf (ALSA) builds.

How to debug node-spotify
-------------------------
Launch node.js and load node-spotify with require.

Attach lldb with $PID=process id of node

    lldb -p $PID

Set a breakpoint with, for example

    breakpoint set --file Album.cc --line 57

In the lldb console, execute this to continue the node.js process

    cont

Now you can execute commands in node.js. That lead to the breakpoint.

If you want to attach additional breakpoints, interrupt the process with

    process interrupt

in lldb.
